          <div class="me">
            <p>Salutations. The name given is Muhammad Danish Alif bin Mohammadazian. I'm currently 22 years old, and hailing from the vacation town of Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan.
                I was born in October 5, 2001 in Seremban, the capital city of Negeri Sembilan to Mohammadazian Mokhtar and Siti Aisah Abdul Gani.
            </p>
            <p>I recieved my first schooling in Port Dickson, and then my elementary education in Sekolah Kebangsaan Mambau, Seremban.
                       Then I continued my Secondary studies at Sekolah Menengah Agama Dato' Klana Petra Maamor, also in Seremban. As of now I'm furthering my studies in UiTM Negeri Sembilan, Rembau Campus, pursuing a Diploma in Information Management. </h4></p>
          <p>I have a flair for languages and sciences studies. Malay, my native tongue of course, as well as
                       English, are a heck of a dynamic duo of my favourite languages. Furthermore, I also considered to learn 
                       Russian, French and German someday. Speaking of sciences, I love mathematics, physics, biology, and
                        meteorology.</p>
          </div></p>
                    <p>My favourite foods are nasi lemak, char kway teow, fried noodles, sushi, kimchi, etc. Ginger tea is my guilty pleasure drink, either served with milk or plain.</p>
          <p>My hobbies may vary. Reading, eating, listening to music, you name it. When it comes to music, slow rock and EDM are my favourite genres. But the most favoured of all is storm chasing. I've always been fascinated by severe weather since I was seven. I looked up to some of the world's most prolific storm chasers such as Drs. Reed Timmer and Tim Samaras as my inspiration.</p>
            <p>I'm the first born of 4 siblings. The following table below is the detailed information about them.</p>
